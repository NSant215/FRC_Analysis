# Data

This project utilised data collected and created locally in Cambridge, combined with measurements made in the field in Africa, in order to obtain a variety of different inputs that could simulate different water scenarios.

## Data Naming Conventions
All the data has been separated in the 'Data' folder.
'MC' refers to Midsummer's Common - a point on the river cam where samples were collected.
'JL' refers to Jesus Lock - same as above.
All samples from Kenya have 'Kenya' in the name.
